# Companion Introduction

This document is a partial collection of notes to accompany the second edition
of Marsland's textbook _Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective_. It was
written as a part of an honors course in machine learning I took at Oglethorpe
University.

The different sections of this were written with different intentions. Some of
them are my notes from the lectures in class, while some of them are notes I
prepared for my own "lectures" as a part of the honors class. This gives some
variability to each section. Some sections are bullet points recounting the
text's material, some offer the viewpoint of a different source, and some could
serve as lecture notes.  There is a rough chronological ordering to the notes,
e.g.  Chapter 1 is first, then Chapter 2, etc, but the sections themselves are
not currently numbered here.

_An Algorithmic Perspective_ covers a wide array of topics, provides exercises
and references for further reading, almost always gives an outline of
algorithms and often has implementations available online. There are numerous
examples of algorithms being run, and the text _usually_ manages to stay away
from complicated formalism for introductions.

The presentation in the book could be better. There are enough typos that I
worried what formulas were typed correctly in the book. At times the writing is
verbose, and after pages of text the reader is left wondering what the point
was. At times the opposite is true, and the reader is left to puzzle out how a
mess of equations applies to the problem at hand. I did a lot of flipping
through the book while I read it; both to get to the point of a long-winded
section, and to try and find earlier explanations of mathematical topics.

The mathematics in the book is not pitched at a constant level. As the book
continues, the math tends to get more sophisticated, but the author never takes
the time to explain it all. That is fair, since this is not a math book. I
would say that a good course in linear algebra is a good thing to have to make
it through some of the more sophisticated sections. (At the time I wrote these
notes, I hadn't had one yet. When explaining the math, I made judgement calls
when I had to. Take it with a grain of salt.)

Finally, the book chooses to not use any machine learning libraries. I do not
know if this is good or bad. On the one hand, we see how to build the
algorithms from scratch, without too many optimizations. On the other hand, in
an actual project, I would opt to use libraries like `scikit-learn` over the
code in the book.

Hopefully the notes here will help someone else, even if only to frustrate them
enough to write an even better companion.


# Introduction

The introduction of Section 1.2 is dense, but contains important points.
Machine learning generally tries to emulate the following process:

- _Remembering_ past examples.
- _Adapting_ memory of past examples for the present.
- _Generalizing_ knowledge to handle new examples.

The four main types of learning algorithms are summarized in a list in Section
1.3, reproduced here:

- _Supervised learning_, where training inputs have target outputs.
- _Unsupervised learning_, where inputs do not have target outputs.

- _Reinforcement learning_, where an evaluator is told when they are wrong, but
  not the answer.

- _Evolutionary learning_, where random solutions are generated to maximize
  some fitness function.

These classifications are slightly arbitrary. Reinforcement learning and the
fitness function in evolutionary learning are both very much like supervised
learning.

A rough sketch of the overall learning process is given in Section 1.5,
reproduced here:

1. Data Collection and Preparation
2. Feature Selection
3. Algorithm Choice
4. Parameter and Model Selection
5. Training
6. Evaluation

No learning takes place until the Training step. The steps before it are
entirely focused on finding data and tailoring the learning algorithm choice to
the problem at hand.

Section 1.6 ("A Note on Programming") could be important. Random programs
aren't reproducible, so the `np.random.seed()` call is necessary for debugging
specific cases. Aside from this method of debugging, reference programs are
very useful â€” mostly to see where we went wrong in our implementation.

## Complexity of Learning Algorithms

The reason for machine learning existing is because data sets are too large for
humans to analyze. The inputs that learning algorithms receive will be much
larger than most algorithms, so time complexity will be very important. For a
data set of ten-thousand, the difference between $O(n^2)$ and $O(n^3)$ is huge.

Learning algorithms can be roughly split into two components:

- _Learning_ (looking at training data); and
- _Application_ (applying the trained algorithm to data).

The complexity of a learning algorithm can be measured in both of these parts.

Given $n$ training inputs, the complexity of learning will be _at least_
$O(n)$; we have to at least look at each input once. Generally, this process is
expected to have more complexity and take longer than application.

Given $n$ inputs, we would like for application to be _no more_ complex than,
say, $O(n^2)$; any more and we risk taking too long to be useful.

## Supervised Learning

The book makes a point to introduce supervised learning here, but there is
really only one point to make.

In supervised learning, a sequence of points $(x_i, t_i)$ is given. For each
$x_i$, the element $t_i$ is the _correct_ answer to classifying $x_i$. The goal
is for the algorithm to learn from these pairs and be able to correctly match
each $x_i$ with $t_i$.

Usually, $(x_i)$ is a sample of the set of all possible inputs, so the
algorithm should also generalize its learning to inputs _not_ in $(x_i)$.

The regression example in 1.4.1 is a nice way to reframe what most people know
about regression. Given a sequence of points $(x_i, y_i)$, the sequence $(x_i)$
is the sequence of $x$-coordinates, and $(t_i)$ is the sequence of
$y$-coordinates.

The classification example in 1.4.2 is basically regression but with a discrete
range for the function.

## Examples of Noise

The _noise_ in a data set refers to the random fluctuations that are not
relevant for classification or prediction. As a fabricated example, a
collection of identical thermometers next to each other may give slightly
different readings due to the noise of the environment around them.

For a more concrete example, suppose that we are using supervised learning,
and we have the following two training points:
\begin{align*}
    ((0, 0, 0), 1) \\
    ((0, 0, 0), 0)
\end{align*}
After training, if the input $(0, 0, 0)$ is seen, there is no reliable way to
determine if the output should be $0$ or $1$. This is an extreme example of
noise, where one input appears to have two different targets associated with
it.

As a more realistic example, consider the following training points:
\begin{align*}
    ((0, 0, 0), 0) \\
    ((1, 1, 1), 1)
\end{align*}
If we then see the input $(0, 0, 1)$, it is possible that the single $1$ is due
to random noise. Hence it is difficult to decide if the output should be $0$ or
some intermediate value.


# Preliminaries

The terminology introduced in 2.1 is very biased towards supervised learning,
and neural networks in particular. Input and output vectors ($\vec{x}$ and
$\vec{y}$) are pretty general; but weights and activation functions ($\vec{W}$
and $g(\cdot)$) are mostly associated with neural networks, and targets
($\vec{t}$) are only for supervised learning.

## Distance Formula

The distance formula is introduced here in the context of neural networks. The
rough idea is to treat weights of neurons as coordinates in space, and have the
neurons fire if they are "close enough" to an input vector. The distance
function can be used generally to measure how far away inputs are from some
target.

This concept doesn't seem to be used in the chapter, so it feels a little out
of place. 

## The Curse of Dimensionality

The point of the hypersphere argument is unclear. In summary, as the number of
dimensions increases, we will need much more data to train on. This is because
the data will, in general, tend to be more spread out.

To explain the hypersphere argument, construct a unit box in an arbitrary
number of dimensions. Think of the hypersphere as our target; that is, if we
pick a random point from the unit box, we want it to be in the sphere. If we
are picking the points randomly, the probability of a point being in the sphere
is $V(S) / V(B)$, where $V(S)$ and $V(B)$ are the volumes of the sphere and
box, respectively.

As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the sphere does not grow
as quickly as the volume of the cube, so the probability of picking a point in
the sphere at random decreases simply because we added more dimensions.

This idea will apply to our learning algorithms. Our classifiers will be less
accurate as the number of dimensions in our inputs increases, just because of
the greater spread. Thus we will need much more data as the number of
dimensions we use increases.

## Accuracy Metrics

Accuracy metrics are useful to compare different methods of learning to each
other.

Leave out some, crossfold validation ($K$-Fold Cross Validation): Split data
into different chunks, and assign some chunks to be training, some to be
validation, and some to be testing. For every possible combination of
assignments, train a new model on the created data set, then take the best
model. (There was a very pretty picture.)

## Training, Testing, and Validation Sets

During learning, we are always given a data set of examples. In supervised
learning, we will partition the data into three different sets:

- _Training_: Used to train a classifier.
- _Validation_: Used to test the accuracy of a classifier independent of the
  the classifier has never been trained on, to test for overfitting.
- _Testing_: Used to test the final accuracy of a classifier against data it
  has never even seen.

It is important that these sets be disjoint. The point of the validation set is
to test both for accuracy and overfitting. If points from the validation set
are in the training set, then the classifier may overfit to the validation set,
destroying its intended metric. The same point can be made for the testing set.

It is also important that these sets be randomly chosen. If there is some sort
of bias, then the classifier could inherit this bias. For example, suppose that
a data set is sorted low-to-high for some feature. If we just take the first
60% of the data to be training, 20% to be validation, and 20% to be testing,
then the classifier would only be trainined on the lower-end values of this
feature.

Discussion questions:

- Why do we have training sets and test sets? (We need to test for
  generalization and overfitting.)

- What purpose does the validation set serve? (It offers an intermediate
  overfitting metric before testing.)

- When is the test set used? (Only after all training is complete.)

- Why is overfitting bad? (We might not be able to apply our algorithm to data
  outside of the training set.)

### $K$-fold Cross-Validation

When we have lots of data, partitioning the data into training, validation, and
testing sets is fairly simple. If we do not have lots of data, we can use the
method of $K$-fold cross validation.

Briefly:

- Randomly partition the data into $K$ subsets.
- Choose one subset for validation, another for testing, and combine the rest
  to be training.
- Train a classifier on these given sets.
- Repeat with a new classifier for all possible random partitions, then take
  the one with the best testing accuracy.

## Accuracy Metrics

Accuracy is simply the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the
total number of inputs: the estimated probability that we can correctly
classify inputs.

- _Sensitivity_ is the ratio correct positives over total positives present:
  the estimated probability that we can correctly classify inputs given that
  they are positive; cf. $P($Classified True $\mid$ True$)$. _Specificity_ is
  analogous, but for negatives; cf. $P($Classified False $\mid$ False$)$.

- _Precision_ is the ratio of correct positives over all classified positives:
  the estimated probability that an input was correctly classified positive
  given that we did classify it positive; cf. $P($True $\mid$ Classified
  True$)$. Sort of the converse of sensitivity^[This is bunk. -- Dr.
  Patterson].

- The _$F_1$ metric_ is the ratio of correct positives over the sum of correct
  positives and average number of misclassifications; it is one if and only if
  there are no misclassifications, and strictly less than one otherwise.

The text mentions the implicit assumption of a balanced data sets for these
metrics. This assumption comes into play because many of these metrics will be
misleading if a large majority of data is negative or positive. For example,
consider a data set that is a snapshot of infections in a population of a rare
disease. Most inputs will be negatives, so models that always classify negative
will have specificity of one, but will not have actually learned how to detect
the disease.

## The Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve

The ROC curve is mostly well explained. A curve that looks as smooth as the
ones in the book will require either a lot of points, or some kind of
regression curve.

## NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier

Given the feature vector $\vec{X_j}$, to compute $P(C_i \mid \vec{X_j})$, we
need to compute $P(X_j^1 = a_1,\ X_j^2 = a_2,\ \dots,\ X_j^n = a_n \mid C_i)$.
We may not be able to find a point such that $X_j^k = a_k$ holds for every
valid $k$. This is an issue, because then the joint probability is impossible,
and so $P(\vec{X_j} = \vec{a} \mid C_i) = 0$.

To make this easier, we make the simplifying assumption that the components
$X_j^k = a_k$ are independent from each other. Then, $P(X_j^1 = a_1,\ X_j^2 =
a_2,\ \dots,\ X_j^n = a_n \mid C_i) = P(X_j^1 = a_1 \mid C_i) P(X_j^i = a_2
\mid C_i) \cdots P(X_j^n = a_n \mid a_n)$. This lets us find examples that
satisfy each value separately, instead of looking for examples that satisfy
_every_ value restriction.


# Neurons and Neural Networks

## Neurons

- Hebb's Rule postulates that the relationship between neurons is determined by
  how often they fire simultaneously. This allows us to formulate our model of
  how neurons learn.

- Given MCP neurons, we can only modify the weights and the threshold. These
  are updated using the perceptron algorithm.

A positive weight from node A to node B indicates that positive inputs in A
generally imply B. A negative weight from A to B indicates that positive inputs
in A generally imply not B.

## Perceptrons

### Introduction

- Perceptrons are networks of MCP neurons, where there is a layer of inputs and
  a layer of MCP neurons. Every input is connected to every neuron in the
  network.

Weights are updated by punishing the weights that do poorly (mismatch the
target).

- Find nodes where $y_k \neq t_k$, and consider the positive weights.
- If $y_k > t_k$, then positive inputs are contributing too much.
- If $y_k < t_k$, then positive inputs are not contributing enough.

This method only works if we have a positive input. If we have a negative
input, then we need to do the opposite. For example, if $y_k > t_k$ and $x_k$
was negative, then the weight did not add enough value to $x_k$ to stop the
firing, so the weight must be increased. This rule is succinctly described by
$$\Delta w_{ik} = -(y_k - t_k) x_i,$$ where $\Delta w_{ik}$ is the amount of
change to weight $w_{ik}$, i.e. $w^{k + 1}_{ik} = w^k_{ik} + \Delta
w^{ik}_{ik}$. The following properties are easy to verify:

- If $y_k > t_k$ (misfire):
    - If $x_k > 0$, then the weight decreases. ($w_k x_k$ added too much.)
    - If $x_k < 0$, then the weight increases. ($w_k x_k$ did not take away
      enough.)
- If $y_k < t_k$ (should have fired):
    - If $x_k > 0$, then the weight increases. ($w_k x_k$ did not add enough.)
    - If $x_k < 0$, then the weight decreases. ($w_k x_k$ took away too much.)

The only remaining component is the learning rate, $\eta$. It is essentially
like a step size, i.e. how far we should step in the direction of the "correct"
descent.

### Perceptron Convergence Theorem

Amazingly, for some datasets, Perceptrons are guaranteed to learn them in
finite time. These datasets are called _linearly separable_, and to talk about
them, we need to discuss more about what the Perceptron is actually doing.

The weights of perceptrons define a _decision boundary_. If an input falls on
one side of the decision boundary, it it classified one way; if it falls on the
other side, the other way. This decision boundary is, in general, a hyperplane
defined by the equation $\vec{x}\vec{W}^T = 0$, where $\vec{W}$ is the weight
vector for a single perceptron.

A dataset is called _linearly separable_ if there exists a linear separator
that correctly classifies the dataset. More formally, if we can partition the
dataset into two disjoint classes $C_1$ and $C_2$, then the dataset is linearly
separable iff there exists some weight vector $\vec{W}$ such that $\vec{x}
\vec{W}^T \geq 0$ for all $\vec{x} \in C_1$, and $\vec{x} \vec{W}^T < 0$ for
all $\vec{x} \in C_2$.

The Perceptron Convergence Theorem states that, if a dataset is linearly
separable, then the Perceptron learning algorithm will find a linear separating
weight vector in finite time. That is, the Perceptron will be able to correctly
classify inputs based on which side of the boundary they fall on in finite
time.

### Convergence Time Estimate

The Perceptron Convergence theorem states that, given a linearly separable
dataset, the perceptron will learn a linear separator within $1/\gamma$
updates, where $\gamma$ is defined to be the distance from the linear separator
that the perceptron _will_ converge to and the datapoint closest to it.

As an approximation of $\gamma$, we can use $d$, where $d$ is half of the
smallest distance between any two points of opposite classes. Then, we define
$T' = 1/d^2$, which is _usually_^[He says, using proof by intimidation.] less
than $T$. That is, we we create a convergence time estimate $T'$ such that $T >
T'$.

### Perceptron Linear Regression

Essentially, we use calculus to find the "weight" vector $\vec{\beta}$ that
minimizes the sum of squared errors $$\sum_{k = 0}^N (t_k - y_k)^2 = \sum_{k =
0}^N (t_k - \sum_{j = 0}^m \beta_j x_j).$$

Perceptrons try to draw lines _between_ data, to classify points. Linear
regression tries to draw lines _through_ data, to match the points' class
values.


# MLP in Practice

Recall that slicing on numpy arrays can be done in multiple dimensions. For
example, let `x` be a numpy matrix. Then:

- `x[0]` returns the first row.
- `x[0:3, 0]` returns the first element of the first three rows.
- `x[:3, 0]` is the same as above.
-  `x[:3, :6]` returns the first six elements of the first three rows.
- `x[:3, -3:]` returns the last three elements of the first three rows.

## When to Stop?

The naÃ¯ve method is to train for $T$ batches, for some constant $T$. There is
no theoretical basis for this. As Dr. Patterson puts it, this method "kinda
sucks."

The next, slightly less naÃ¯ve method is to set an accuracy threshold for the
training set. This could end in an infinite loop if that accuracy is never
reached.

The more analytic approach is to make use of the validation set. In theory,
while the MLP is learning the dataset or function, validation error will be
decreasing. As we begin to overfit the data or function, the validation error
will begin to increase again. Thus we will try to stop training at a local
minimum of the validation error.

Finding this local minimum can be tricky. The book suggests keeping three
previous models during training. If either of the two most recent validation
errors has decreased enough from the validation error before themselves, then
continue training. We check both so that a minor fluctuation in validation
error will not halt training prematurely.

## Probably Approximately Correct Learning

The book says that, given $W$ weights, we should have roughly $10W$ datapoints
to train on. Dr. Patterson says that, given $L$ inputs, we should have roughly
$2^L$ datapoints.

Neither of these have much theoretical grounding -- they are just practical
rules of thumb. The subset of machine learning called _Probably Approximately
Correct Learning_ is more theoretically grounded.

## Universal Approximation Theorem

The Universal Approximation Theorem states that any neural network, with any
number of of hidden layers and nodes, can be approximated by a single hidden
layer MLP with some amount of nodes. This amount may be very large.

(Actually, it's about approximating convex functions. See [the formal
statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem).)

## 1-of-$N$

Instead of using one number to encode $N$ classes, 1-of-$N$ classifiers use an
$N$-tuple with components zero and one. As an example, with three classes,
class $0$ would become $(1, 0, 0)$, class $1$ $(0, 1, 0)$, and class $2$ $(0,
0, 1)$.

## Compression

Neural network compression is very lossy. By cutting down from $k$ inputs to $N
< k$ activations in the hidden layer, we will always lose information.

(Can we get a bound on this? For example, if the hidden layers are activating
to some finite set of integers, say zero and one, then there would be $2^L$
possible inputs to remember.)

## Recipe for MLP

1. Select inputs and outputs.

2. Normalize inputs to some interval, usually $[0, 1]$.

3. Split dataset into training, validation, and testing.
    - Various splits are possible. Common ones are 50/25/25 and 60/20/20.

4. Decide on NN architecture.
    - How many layers?
    - How many nodes in each layer? (Too many and we lose accuracy, not enough
      and we might overfit.)

5. Train network until validation


# Dimensionality Reduction

The book makes a big deal about the "curse of dimensionality," referring to how
computational complexity and the amount of data needed to train a learning
algorithm increases with the number of dimensions in a dataset. In this
chapter, we will learn ways to fight the curse.

There are three main ways to do this:

- __Feature selection__: Throw out features that aren't useful to learning. We
  saw an example of this with tree learning. We looked at every feature and
  decided what would be the best one to examine, adding features until we had a
  perfect classifier or had no more features.

- __Feature derivation__: Create new features using combinations of old ones,
  then throw out the old ones. See Figure 6.1 for an example.

- __Clustering__: Group together similar datapoints and see if this provides
  hints for features that could be removed.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear discriminant analysis attempts to cluster data by projecting it onto a
hyperplane. The hope is that classes will be separated far enough on the
hyperplane so that their distance along the line will be enough to cluster them.
This reduces the dimensions of the data down to one, a single scalar.

There are two metrics that we consider in LDA:

- __Within-class scatter__: The total amount of scatter between datapoints
  inside the same class. The total "spread" of the dataset on an _intra_-class
  level. Measured as $$S_W = \sum_{\text{classes} \ c} p_c \operatorname{cov}(c,
  c),$$ where $p_c$ is the probability of a class occurring, and
  $\operatorname{cov}(c, c)$ is the covariance matrix of the class $c$. Note
  that this is a matrix.

- __Between-class scatter__: The total amount of spread between classes
  themselves. The total "spread" of the dataset on an _inter_-class level.
  Measured as $$S_B = \sum_{\text{classes} \ c} (\vec{\mu}_c -
  \vec{\mu})(\vec{\mu}_c - \vec{\mu})^T,$$ where $\vec{\mu}$ is the mean of the
  entire dataset. Note that this is a matrix, as we are dealing with column
  vectors.

We would like for $S_W$ to be small, and $S_B$ to be big. That is, we would like
to maximize the ratio $S_B / S_W$.

We will be maximizing this ratio by choosing the hyperplane with the "best"
spread to project our data onto, described by the unit vector $\vec{w}$. For any
datapoint $\vec{x}$, the scalar projection onto our hyperplane is $\vec{w} \cdot
\vec{x}$.  If we compute the within-class and between-class scatter using the
scalar projections, we obtain (through some linear algebra)

\begin{align*}
    S_W' &= \vec{w}^T S_W \vec{w} \\
    S_B' &= \vec{w}^T S_B \vec{w}.
\end{align*}

Thus, we want to maximize the ratio $\frac{\vec{w}^T S_W \vec{w}}{\vec{W^T} S_B
\vec{w}}$. In general, this is only easy if we have two classes. With two
classes, the plane that will maximize this ratio is in the direction of
$$\vec{w} = S_W^{-1} (\mu_1 - \mu_2).$$

## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

Principal Components Analysis attempts to separate unlabeled data by
transforming points so that only dimensions that datapoints "vary" along are
examined. It is a type of feature selection.

\newcommand{\cov}[1]{\operatorname{cov}\left( #1 \right)}

The motivation for the algorithm is very linear algebra heavy. The gist is this:

- We have a (centered) data matrix $X$ with covariance matrix
  $\operatorname{cov}(X)$.
- Besides centering the data, we now want to rotate it. This will be done by
  multiplying by a rotation matrix $P^T$. Our new dataset is $Y = P^T X$.
- We want, for some reason, to choose $P^T$ such that $\operatorname{cov}(Y)$ is
  diagonalizable. That is, $$\cov{Y} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda_1 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
    \vdots & \lambda_2 & \cdots & \cdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \lambda_3 & \cdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    \cdots & & & & \lambda_n
  \end{bmatrix}.$$
- From definition of covariance, we arrive at $\operatorname{cov}(Y) = P^T
  \operatorname{cov}(X)P$. Since $P$ is a rotation matrix, its transpose is its
  inverse. This leads us to $$P \operatorname{cov}(Y) = P P^T \cov{X} P =
  \cov{X} P.$$
- If we write $P$ as a list of column vectors $P = [\vec{p}_1, \vec{p}_2, \dots,
  \vec{p}_n]$, then we have $$P\cov{Y} = [\lambda_1 \vec{p}_1, \lambda_2
  \vec{p}_2, \dots, \lambda_n \vec{p}_n] = \cov{X}P.$$
- Since the two matrices are equal, so are their columns. Splitting this into a
  system of equations, we have $$\vec{\lambda} \vec{p}_k = \cov{X} \vec{p}_k.$$
- This leads us to the conclusion that the columns of $P$ are eigenvectors of
  $\cov{X}$.
- The covariance is square and symmetric, so its full complement of eigenvalues
  are orthogonal, and thus form an eigenspace. This means that each eigenvalue
  roughly corresponds to one dimensions. We want to choose the dimensions that
  have the larger eigenvalues.

Algorithmic sketch:

1. Begin with centered data matrix $X$.
2. Compute the covariance matrix $C$.
3. Find the eigensystem of $C$, and arrange the eigenvectors in decreasing
order.
4. Select a number of dimensions to keep, then take this number of the largest
eigenvectors.
5. Use the selected eigenvectors to transform the data, dropping the dimensions
that aren't selected.


## Factor Analysis

The text's explanation of factor analysis is esepcially brief.

Factor analysis works to create a simple linear model to describe a dataset
where the elements of the model are noisy random variables. That is, given a
data matrix $X$, we construct the model $$X = W F + \epsilon,$$ where $F$ is a
random matrix describing a set of "factors" that we think are largely
responsible for the data, $W$ is a matrix of "factor loadings" that describe
how the factors affect the measurements, and $\epsilon$ is a normal random
matrix with mean zero and variances $\psi_i$ that represents the "noise" in the
data. Our goal is to find a matrix $W$ and set of variances $\psi_i$ that
maximize the likelihood of observing $X$ given our model.

As a brief example, say that $X$ are the results of an IQ test. Then, we might
have $$F =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \text{IQ}_1 & \text{Height}_1 \\
    \text{IQ}_2 & \text{Height}_2
\end{bmatrix}$$
and $$W =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0
\end{bmatrix},$$
since the results of the IQ test are dependent only on the subject's IQ.

Factor analysis is an EM algorithm, meaning it is composed of two very simple
steps that are impossible to explain. Essentially, we compute the expectation
of observing our data given the current model, differentiate it to maximize the
expectation, update $W$ and each $\psi_i$, and repeat until convergence. The
steps are outlined on pages 141 and 142, with a partial code listing on page
142.

## Locally Linear Embedding

(The text has a lot of confusing notation in this section. I decdided what
things should be, but the code listings given should probably be consulted.)

Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) works to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
by transforming higher dimensional vectors into lower dimensional ones that
minimize the "reconstruction error" of the lower dimenison. Broadly speaking,
the algorithm chooses neighborhoods around points, then places the points into
a lower dimensional space around the neighborhood that minimizes some error
metric.

The algorithm first chooses a neighborhood around each datapoint. These
neighborhoods can be created in many different ways, e.g. in the "topological"
sense of all points within a distance $d$, or in the $k$-nearest neighbors
sense of grabbing the closest $k$ points.

After choosing a neighborhood around a point $\vec{x}_i$, the remaining points
are used to "reconstruct" (approximate) $\vec{x}_i$. Each point in the dataset
is assigned a weight in this reconstruction, denoted $W_{ij}$. For every
$\vec{x}_j$ not in the neighborhood of $\vec{x}_i$, we set $W_{ij} = 0$. Then,
we have $$\vec{x}_i \approx \sum_{j = 1}^N W_{ij} \vec{x}_j,$$ where $N$ is the
number of datapoints. The dataset is then assigned a reconstruction error
$\epsilon$ that is the sum-of-squares error in the reconstruction
approximations: $$\epsilon = \sum_{i = 1}^N \left| \vec{x}_i - \sum_{j = 1}^N
W_{ij} \vec{x}_j \right|^2.$$

There is no need to construct $W$ by hand. There is a method for choosing $W$
such that $\epsilon$ is minimized:

- For each point $\vec{x}_i$, construct its neighborhood. Create a list of
  neighbor points $\vec{z}_j$, $j = 1, 2, \dots, K$. Let $\vec{d}_j = \vec{z} -
  \vec{x}_i$ be the difference from each neighbor to $\vec{x}_i$. Form a matrix
  $D$ of these differences. ($D$ must be $N \times N$, which I am not sure how
  neighborhoods are guaranteed to be disjoint. For the brave, there is a
  partial code listing on page 146.)

- Compute the "local covariance," defined as $C = D D^T$. (I believe that this
  works out to actually be the covariance of $D$, but it's hard to follow with
  all the vectors around.)

- Solve $CW = I$ for $W$, where $I$ is the $N \times N$ identity. That is, $W =
  C^{-1}$.

- Set $W_{ij} = 0$ when $x_j$ is not in the neighborhood of $x_i$. (In the
  topological sense, I feel confident that "in the neighborhood of" is a
  symmetric relation, but not so sure for $K$-nearest neighbors.)

- Normalize the elements so that the matrix sums to one, i.e. set $W_{ik} =
  W_{ij}/\sum W_{ij}$.

This gives us an "ideal" reconstruction matrix $W$ to play with.

Next, we get to the "embedding" part. We will choose an arbitrary lower
dimension $L$, and construct the point $\vec{y}_i$ that corresponds to
$\vec{x}_i$ in $\mathbf{R^L}$. In this lower dimensional space, we create a new
reconstruction error $\epsilon_L$, defined as $$\epsilon_L = \sum_{i = 1}^N
\left| \vec{y}_i - \sum_{j = 1}^L W_{ij} \vec{y}_j \right|^2.$$ Note the
similarity with the previous reconstruction error. To futher this analogy, we
want to choose $\vec{y}_i$ such that $\epsilon_L$ is minimized. The text punts
hard, and says that these vectors are given by the eigenvectors of the
_quadratic form matrix_ $$M = (I - W)^T (I - W).$$

The full algorithm strings these steps together, and can be found on page 145.


# Probabilistic Learning

A criticism of neural networks is that we cannot "see" what they are doing.
Weights and biases may work, but they have no intuitive meaning. Other learning
methods work well and are more transparent. Decision trees^[Decision trees,
Chapter 12, are referred to in the past tense in this chapter, Chapter 7.] are
one example. In this chapter, we will present another, based on statistical
methods.

Highlights:

- EM Algorithm
- Unsupervised learning example
- Nearest neighbor methods
- Statistical methods

## Gaussian Mixture Models

Note that the text says, in Chapter 7, that "we _will_ [emphasis added] see
lots of ways to deal" with unlabeled examples in Chapter 6. We have already
seen Chapter 6, in theory.

- $M$: number of Gaussian distributions.
- $\alpha_m$: "weight" of distribution $m$.
- $\sum_{m = 1}^M \alpha_m = 1$.
- $\phi(x; \mu_m, \sigma_m)$: normal function with specified parameters.

Define $$P(x_i \in C_k) = \frac{\alpha_k \phi(x_i; \mu_k, \sigma_k)}{\sum_{m =
1}^M \alpha_m \phi(x_i; \mu_m, \sigma_m)}$$ to be the probability of input $x_i$
belonging to class $C_k$.

Say that we have two normals $G_1$ and $G_2$, where $p$ is the probability of a
datapoint beloning to $G_1$. Suppose that $p$ is also a random variable, and
has probability density function $\pi$. From the above model, we have the
random variable $$y = pG_1 + (1 - p)G_2.$$ The probability of any particular
value of $y$ occuring is $$P(y) = \pi \phi(y; \mu_1, \sigma_1) + (1 - \pi)
\phi(y; \mu_2, \sigma_2).$$

Our goal now is to iterate, trying to move the Gaussian models to fit our data
correctly. For example, we will move $\mu_1$ until the curve over $\mu_1$ seems
to be a good fit of the data.

Essentially, $\gamma_i$ is an estimate of $P(x_i \in C_1)$. After calculating
every $\gamma_i$, we have a rough picture of what the data looks like from our
previous guesses. From this, we move the means, standard deviations, and
probability $\pi$ around so that we fit the data better. We repeat this until
our parameters converge.

Example:

$$D = \{5, 10, 4, 6, 5, 4, 6, 11, 10, 9, 5, 7, 3\}.$$
From drawing a graph, we conjecture that there are two normals, with
\begin{align*}
    \mu_1 &= 5, \quad \sigma_1 = 2, \quad \pi = \frac{9}{13} \\
    \mu_2 &= 10, \quad \sigma_2 = 1.
\end{align*}

After performing first M-step, we have

\begin{align*}
    \mu_1 &= 4 \\
    \mu_2 &= 11 \\
    \bar{y} &= 6.54 \\
    \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 &= 6.38 \\
    \pi = 0.4
\end{align*}

## Information Criteria

We are familiar with the validation set. This set can be used to determine when
to stop training, i.e. stop when the validation error is at a local minimum.
However, there are other ways to determine when to stop training. In
particular, one way to do this is by measuring _information criteria_.

Given models, we have two information criteria. The _Akaike Information
Criterium_ $$\text{AIC} = \ln \mathcal{L} - k,$$ and the _Bayesian Information
Criterium_ $$\text{BIC} = 2\ln \mathcal{L} - k \ln N.$$ Here, $k$ is the number
of parameters in the model, $N$ is the number of datapoints, and $\mathcal{L}$
is "best likelihood of the model." The book is very quiet about what this is or
how to calculate it.

## EM Algorithm

1. __Expectation__: Compute the expected liklihood of the model.

2. __Maximization__: Update the model to maximize the expected likihood.


# Support Vector Machines

## Perceptrons and their Limitations

In Chapter 3, we encountered a simple type of neural network which could
compute many functions: the __Perceptron__.

As a quick summary of the material in the Perceptron section, recall:

- The perceptron defines a _decision boundary_, $\vec{x}\vec{W}^T = 0$

    - In 2D, this is a line between classes.
    - In 3D, this is a plane.
    - In higher dimensions, we call this a hyperplane.

- The Perceptron Convergence Theorem guarantees finite-time convergence for
  linearly separable data sets.

    - If we can draw a line, or plane, or hyperplane between classes in input
      space, then the perceptron will find a line that can do this.

    - This will happen in a finite amount of time.

Now, this theorem only applies to linearly separable datasets. If a dataset is
not linearly separable, then there might be issues.

- Perceptrons might not work if the input space is not linearly separable.

    - For example, take the 2D XOR function.

    - Cannot draw a line between the XOR data, so it's not linearly separable.

    - A perceptron will waffle between incorrect inputs, and never converge to
      a correct answer.

    - This can be fixed by adding extra dimensions.

## Enter: Support Vector Machines

(This was written for section 8.1, but also from a [Stanford webpage on
SVMs](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/support-vector-machines-the-linearly-separable-case-1.html).)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) provide two important things:

1. An objective way to choose the _best_ decision boundary; and

2. A set of methods to transform any dataset into one that is linearly
separable. (Example: 3D XOR function.)

That is, using SVMs, we can always linearly separate data by transforming it.

Also, after a brief training period, SVMs only need to remember a select few
training points to classify new points.

- The _margin_ of a linear separator is the largest radius $M$ such that no
  data points lie within $M$ units of the hyperplane defined by the separator.

- If there exists a linear separator with a margin larger than any other, it is
  the _maximum margin classifier_. This is considered to be the optimal linear
  separator.

- Points that are exactly $M$ units away from a linear classifier are called
  _support vectors_. (Measured by $|\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b| = M$.)

- The margin of a linear classifier with weights $\vec{w}$ is $1/|\vec{w}|$.
  (The derivation is rather long, and very confusing in our textbook. See the
  Stanford webpage for a better derivation.)

- Given a point $\vec{x}$ with target $t = \pm 1$, a measure of the goodness of
  the classification of $\vec{x}$ is the _functional distance_ $t(\vec{w} \cdot
  \vec{x} + b)$.

    - General measure of how well classified a point is; the larger the value
      is, the better it was classified.

    - Positive for correct classifications, and negative for incorrect
      classifications.

### Finding the Maximum Margin Classifier

We need to

1. Find the largest margin possible; and

2. Make sure that classifications are still "good."

Maximizing the margin is the same as minimizing $\frac{1}{2} |\vec{w}|^2$.  The
$\frac{1}{2}$ factor is for convenience, and the square does not effect
anything, since the square root function is increasing for nonnegative inputs
anyway.

For the "good" requirement, we arbitrarily require that the functional distance
is greater than one. That is, that $t (\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b) \geq 1$.
Equality is obtained only with support vectors.

This gives us a constrained optimization problem:

Let $\vec{x_i}$ and $t_i$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ be sequences of input vectors
and targets, respectively, where $t_i = \pm 1$. Then,

$$\text{minimize } \frac{1}{2} |\vec{w}|^2 \text{ under the constraint } t
(\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b) \geq 1, i = 1, 2, \dots, n.$$

This problem can be solved using the Karushâ€“Kuhnâ€“Tucker (KKT) method, which is
a generalization of the method of Lagrange multipliers that allows for
inequalities. Once the problem has been set up, we can place it into a solver
that will do the heavy lifting for us. We will not get too much into this right
now^[Because I don't understand it.], but here are the high points:

- We seek a $\vec{w}^*$ and $b^*$ such that $\vec{w}^* \cdot \vec{x} + b* = 0$
  is a maximum margin classifier.

- The solver will provide us with a vector of Lagrange multipliers
  $\vec{\lambda}$ such that $$\vec{w}^* = \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k
  \vec{x_k}$$ and $$b^* = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\text{support vectors } s}
  \left(t_j - \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \vec{x_k} \cdot \vec{x_s} \right),$$
  where $N$ is the number of support vectors.

This method will allow us to find an optimal minimum classifier for any
linearly separable dataset. The next step for SVMs is handling datasets that
are not linearly separable.

### Questions and Clarifications

- In the definition of a margin, $M$ is defined to be the largest radius such
  that no datapoints lie within $M$ units of the hyperplane. In Figure 8.2, the
  margin bounding region is drawn with a solid line, indicating that no points
  lie exactly $M$ units away. In other words, for every datapoint $\vec{x}$, we
  have $|\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b| > M$.

    Almost immediately, support vectors are defined to be the points $\vec{x}$
    such that $\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b = M$. So, let's all just agree that the
    boundary line in Figure 8.2 should be dotted, and that every datapoint
    $\vec{x}$ satisfies $|\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b| \geq M$.

- After Equation 8.11, the text mentions that the SVM's optimal linear
  classifier has the property that prediction relies on computing the dot
  product of the input vector and _only_ the support vectors. However, the
  relevant term is $$\vec{z} \cdot \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \vec{x_k},$$
  which is certainly over all training vectors $\vec{x_k}$, and not just the
  support vectors. What are they talking about?

## Kernels

As previously mentioned, the point of a linear classifier to draw a hyperplane
between linearly separable datasets. This was not always possible when datasets
were not linearly separable, as in the case of the XOR function. To fix this,
we will introduce kernels, which are computationally simple ways to make any
dataset linearly separable.

### Transformations

Let $X$ be our input space; usually this is some $\mathbf{R^n}$. To transform
our datapoints $\vec{x} \in X$, we will define a _feature mapping_ $\phi\colon
X \to V$ such that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is the transformation of the input
$\vec{x}$, where $V$ is some other input space, usually of a higher dimension.

Assuming that this mapping creates a linear separable dataset, we can apply the
KKT method to find our optimal linear classifier in this new input space,
giving us the optimal parameters

\begin{align*}
\vec{w}^* &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \phi(\vec{x_k}) \\
b^* &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\text{support vectors } s}
        \left(t_j - \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \phi(\vec{x_k}) \cdot \phi(\vec{x_s}) \right)
\end{align*}

To make predictions of a new input $\vec{z}$, we need to map $z$ with $\phi$,
then compute $$\vec{w}^* \cdot \phi(\vec{z}) + b^*,$$ using these vectors from
the new input space $V$. The vectors of $V$ may have a very large dimension,
and this may take a very long time. To get around this computation, we will
introduce _kernels_.

### Kernels and the Kernel Trick

Let $K\colon X^2 \to \mathbf{R}$ be a symmetric mapping. Then, $K$ is a _kernel
function_ iff it is positive definite (p.d.), as defined below. That is, the
function $K$ is a kernel iff

- (Positive definite) For all $<c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n> \in \mathbf{R^n}$ and
  $\vec{x_i} \vec{x_j} \in X$, $$\sum_{\substack{1 \leq j \leq n \\ 1 \leq i
  \leq n}} c_i c_j K(\vec{x_i}, \vec{x_j}) \geq 0;$$
- (Symmetric) $K(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) = K(\vec{y}, \vec{x})$ for all $\vec{x},
  \vec{y} \in X$.

The key point of this definition is an application of Mercer's
Theorem[^mercer]: _if there exists a positive definite kernel on an input space
$X$, then there exists a feature mapping $\phi\colon X \to V$ such that
$K(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) = \phi(\vec{x}) \cdot \phi(\vec{y})$._ That is, if we have
a kernel, then we are always implicitly computing the dot product of vectors in
a higher dimension, without ever working in that higher dimension. Using
kernels to avoid this higher-dimensional computation is the _kernel trick_.

[^mercer]: Mercer's Theorem is a result in functional analysis. We will not
talk about it or functional analysis ever again.

Practically, the kernel trick means that by replacing all dot products that the
SVM computes with the kernel computation, we will be implicitly using higher
dimensions. To force linear separability, we punt into a higher dimension, then
the kernel trick punts us right back to where we started.

With the kernel trick in mind, we do not need to find a feature mapping $\phi$
anymore; we only need to find positive definite kernels that are easy to
compute. Luckily, there are a few standard kernels and functions that they come
from:

- The polynomial kernel of degree $d$: $K(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) = (1 + \vec{x}
  \cdot \vec{y})^d$.

- The sigmoid kernel with parameters $k$ and $\delta$: $K(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) =
  \tanh(k \vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} - \delta)$.

- The radial basis function with parameter $\sigma$: $K(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) =
  \exp(-|\vec{x} - \vec{y}|^2 / 2\sigma)$. (The text incorrectly gives the
  vector factor as $(\vec{x} - \vec{y})^2$, which is not a scalar.)

### Kernel Clarification

Question: How does using a kernel actually avoid the computation in the higher
dimension? The formally doesn't readily explain this. Answer: Because of vector
stuff.

Recall that the optimized weight vector, $\vec{w}^*$, is given by the equation
$$\vec{w}^* = \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \vec{x_k},$$ where $t_k$ is the
target for $\vec{x_k}$, and $\vec{\lambda}$ is given by `cvxopt` after
employing KKT. If we use a mapping $\phi\colon X \to V$, then the
classification computation for an input $\vec{z}$ becomes $$\left(\sum_{k =
1}^n \lambda_k t_k \phi(\vec{x_k}) \right) \cdot \phi(\vec{z}) + b^*.$$ Of
course, the inner product is distributive over vector addition, so this becomes
$$\sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k t_k \phi(\vec{x_k}) \cdot \phi(\vec{z}) + b^*.$$ At
this point, knowing a kernel, we can replace the inner product $\phi(\vec{x_k})
\cdot \phi(\vec{z})$ with $K(\vec{x}, \vec{z})$, where $K$ is a kernel of
$\phi$.

Equipped with the kernel, the only thing left to compute is compute $b^*$. This
computation only requires computing dot products $\phi(\vec{x_k}) \cdot
\phi(\vec{x_j})$, which can be replaced with kernel computations.

The book talks about another $K$, the Gram matrix, or the kernel of distances.
This is a confusing name and symbol; as far as I can tell it is not the actual
kernel. The book is remarkably silent on how this matrix works.

## The Karush--Kuhn--Tucker Method

If you were sick of the math _before_...

The Karush--Kuhn--Tucker method is used in support vector machines (SVMs) to
find the optimal linear classifier. It does this by minimizing
$\frac{1}{2}|\vec{w}|^2$ subject to $t_i y_i \geq 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$.
The goal of KKT is to handle this inequality.

Before introducing KKT, we will describe the Lagrangian to see where KKT
differs.

### The Lagrangian

\newcommand{\lag}{\mathcal{L}}

We wish to minimize the function $f(\vec{x})$ subject to the list of
constraints $g_k(\vec{x}) = 0$, $k = 1, 2, \dots, n$. There are two
possibilities:

1. The gradient of $f$ is parallel to the gradient of each $g_k$, so that
moving along $g_k(\vec{x}) = 0$ will not decrease $f$; or

2. The gradient of $f$ is zero, so that $f$ is at a minimum.

The minima of $f$ will _possibly_ occur when one of these two conditions do.
These conditions can be succinctly summarized by defining the Lagrangian
$$\lag(\vec{x}, \vec{\lambda}) = f(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k
g_k(\vec{x}),$$ where $\vec{\lambda}$ is a vector of multiples meant to
describe all possibilities of parallel vectors. At critical points of $\lag$,
i.e. when $\nabla \lag = \vec{0}$, we have $$\frac{\partial \lag}{\partial
\lambda_k} = g_k(\vec{x}) = 0,$$ so that the constraints are satisfied, and
$$\nabla_{\vec{x}} f(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k \nabla_{\vec{x}}
g_k(\vec{x}) = \vec{0},$$ a technical condition that ensures that $\vec{x}$ is
a local minimum[^technicalities]. This gives us enough equations to completely
determine $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{\lambda}$, if such a solutions exists.

[^technicalities]: See [http://math.stackexchange.com/a/453421/261157](this
Math.SE answer). The rough sketch is that, for a point $\vec{x}$ to be a local
minimum for $f$ constrained by each $g_k$, then $\nabla f(\vec{x})$ must belong
to the vector space spanned by each $\nabla g_k$. Or, $\nabla f(\vec{x}) =
\sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k \nabla g_k(\vec{x})$, as stated.

In summary, _if a point is a minimum for the Lagrangian, it is a minimum for
$f$ subject to the given equality constraints._ Thus we solve the system given
by $\nabla \lag = \vec{0}$.

Note that this method only handles equality constraints, i.e. $g(\vec{x}) = 0$.
KKT will allow us to handle inequalities as well.

### KKT: Extending the Lagrangian with Inequalities

For KKT, we keep our equality restraints $g_k(\vec{x}) = 0$, but now add the
list of inequality restraints $$h_j(\vec{x}) \leq 0, \quad j = 1, 2, \dots,
m.$$ Just as we introduced the vector $\vec{\lambda}$ for equality constraints,
we will introduce the vector $\vec{\mu}$ for inequality restraints. Our
Lagrangian becomes $$\lag(\vec{x}, \vec{\lambda}, \vec{\mu}) = f(\vec{x}) +
\sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k g_k(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^m \mu_k h_k(\vec{x}).$$

The procedure for this extended Lagrangian is identical to the original one for
$\vec{x}$. We find the critical points with respect to $\vec{x}$, giving
\begin{equation}
\label{kkt-stationary}
\nabla_{\vec{x}} f(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^n \lambda_k \nabla_{\vec{x}}
g_k(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^m \mu_k \nabla_{\vec{x}} h_k(\vec{x}) = \vec{0}.
\end{equation}
This ensures that $\vec{x}$ is a local minimum.

Next, we find the critical points with respect to $\vec{\lambda}$, but in a
slightly different way. For some reason^[Which I am not clear on at all.], the
solution $\vec{x}$ depends on $\vec{\lambda}$, so we may not treat functions of
$\vec{x}$ as constant with respect to $\vec{\lambda}$. Practically, this means
that we solve
\begin{equation}
\label{kkt-equality}
\nabla_{\vec{\lambda}} f(\vec{x}) + \sum_{k = 1}^n
\nabla_{\vec{\lambda}} (\lambda_k g_k(\vec{x})) + \sum_{k = 1}^m
\nabla_{\vec{\lambda}} (\mu_k h(\vec{x})) = \vec{0}.
\end{equation}

Finally, the inequality restraints are completely different. Instead of solving
$\nabla_{\vec{\mu}} \lag = 0$, for technical reasons, we have the following
requirements:
\begin{align}
\label{kkt-inequality}
\mu_j
h_j(\vec{x}) &= 0, \quad j = 1, 2, \dots, m \\
\mu_j &\geq 0. \label{kkt-nonnegative}
\end{align}

Solving the system given by \eqref{kkt-stationary}, \eqref{kkt-equality},
\eqref{kkt-inequality}, and \eqref{kkt-nonnegative} will give us possible
minima.

## SVM Algorithm Outline

After discussing the theoretical aspect of SVMs, we turn our attention to the
algorithm itself and its implementation. The implementation is provided by the
book, so we will mostly sketch the outline and discuss the software used.

The Python package `cvxopt` (convex optimization) is required for the book's
implementation. The free and open source package package numerically solves
convex optimization problems.  More details can be found at [the cvxopt
homepage](http://cvxopt.org/).

The algorithm is fairly straightforward, math aside. The authors choose to
support three different kernels: the linear, polynomial, and radial basis
function (RBF) kernels. There is some slight initialization to handle this
fact.

1. Compute the Gram matrix $K = XX^T$, where $X$ is the column vector
containing every datapoint.

- Linear kernel: return $K$.
- Polynomial kernel of degree $d$: return $\frac{K^d}{\sigma}$, where $\sigma$
  is a parameter.
- RBF: return $K_{ij} = \exp(-|x_i - x_j|^2 / \sigma^2)$.

2. Solve for $\vec{\lambda}$ using `cvxopt`.

We will use `cvxopt`'s quadratic solver, `cvxopt.solvers.qp()`. Its signature
is `cvxopt.solvers.qp(P, q, G, h, A, b)`, and it minimizes $$\frac{1}{2}
\vec{x} \cdot P\vec{x}$$ subject to $$G\vec{x} \leq \vec{h}, \quad A\vec{x} =
\vec{b}.$$ The text derives the appropriate values for these variables in terms
of the Gram matrix $K$ and $\vec{\lambda}$.

3. Compute $b^*$.

This completes the set up of the SVM. It is now ready to classify new
datapoints.


# Optimization and Search

## Line Searches and Gradient Descent

\newcommand{\reals}{\mathbf{R}}

In many types of learning, we want to minimize some error function $f$. There
are many ways to do this, but the simplest is called a _line search_. In this
method, we have some initial guess for the minima, $\vec{x}_0$, and we follow a
line in some preset direction for some preset distance to the next guess. That
is, we pick our next guess with the equation $$\vec{x}_{n + 1} = \vec{x}_n +
\eta_n \vec{p}_n,$$ where $\vec{p}_n$ is the direction of the line, and
$\eta_n$ is the distance to follow along the line.

With this equation, we are free to pick the direction $\vec{p}_n$ and the
distance $\eta_n$. Different methods of choosing these will give us different
search techniques. For example, setting $\vec{p}_n = -\nabla f(\vec{x}_n)$
gives us gradient descent.

The choice of $\vec{p}_n = -\nabla f(\vec{x}_n)$ is usually due to the fact
that $-\nabla f(\vec{x}_n)$ is the direction of greatest decrease for $f$.
However, we can also derive this direction by considering different
approximations for $f$.

These approximations are extensions of taylor expansions of single-variable
functions. Recall that a single variable function $g(x)$ may be approximated as
$$g(x) \approx g(x_0) + g'(x_0)(x - x_0) + g''(x_0)(x - x_0)^2 + \cdots.$$ For
functions of multiple variables, we will replace $g'$ and $g''$ with more
general "derivatives" called the gradient and Hessian, respectively.

First, we have the linear approximation $$f(\vec{x} + \vec{p}) \approx
f(\vec{x}_n) + \nabla f(\vec{x}_n) \cdot \vec{p} + o(|\vec{p}|).$$ If we
minimize this with respect to $\vec{p}$, we end up with $\vec{p} = -\nabla
f(\vec{x}_n)$, which recovers gradient descent.

Next, we have the quadratic approximation $$f(\vec{x} + \vec{p}) \approx
f(\vec{x}_n) + \nabla f(\vec{x}_n) \cdot \vec{p} + \frac{1}{2} \vec{p}^T
H(f(\vec{x_n})) \vec{p} + o(|\vec{p}|^2),$$ where $H(f(\vec{x}))$ is the
Hessian matrix of second derivatives, $$H(f(\vec{x})) =
\begin{bmatrix}
    f_{x_1 x_1}(\vec{x}) & f_{x_1 x_2}(\vec{x}) & \cdots & f_{x_1 x_n}(\vec{x}) \\
    f_{x_2 x_1}(\vec{x}) & f_{x_2 x_2}(\vec{x}) & \cdots & f_{x_2 x_n}(\vec{x}) \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    f_{x_n x_1}(\vec{x}) & f_{x_n x_2}(\vec{x}) & \cdots & f_{x_n x_n}(\vec{x})
\end{bmatrix}.$$
If we minimize this equation with respect to $\vec{p}$, then we obtain
$$\vec{p} = - (H(f(\vec{x}_n)))^{-1} \nabla f(\vec{x}_n).$$ This direction is
called the _Newton direction_.

The computational complexity of the Newton direction is fairly high; we need to
compute the inverse of the Hessian matrix. However, according to the text, the
payoff is that our step size $\eta$ is always set to one.

## Conjugate Gradients

The goal of conjugate gradients is to spend a little more time thinking about
what directions and how far along them to step to minimize the number of steps
taken. In fact, the goal is, in $n$ dimensions, to take exactly $n$ steps to
reach the minimum of a function.

Except for when the error function is linear, this goal is almost never
reached, but the method of conjugate gradients will still improve on line
searches.

For the direction $\vec{p}_n$, conjugate gradients makes two choices. For the
first step, we follow gradient descent and set $\vec{p}_0 = -\nabla
f(\vec{x}_0)$. After this, we apply what is called a _Gram--Schmidt process_ to
discover the directions. In $n$ dimensions, we create the sequence of $n$
coordinate axis vectors $\vec{u}_k$. Then, the direction is given by
$$\vec{p}_n = \vec{u}_n + \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} \beta_{k} \vec{p}_k,$$ where
$$\beta_{k} = \frac{|\nabla f(\vec{x}_k)|^2}{|\nabla f(\vec{x}_{k - 1})|^2}.$$

For the step size $\alpha_n$, conjugate gradients uses Newton--Raphson
iteration to derive the optimal $$\alpha_n = \frac{\nabla f(\vec{x}_n) \cdot
\vec{p}}{\vec{p}^T H(f(\vec{x}_n)) \vec{p}}.$$

From here, the algorithm on page 200 is fairly straightforward. It is
essentially the line search, but making the choices described above.


# The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

(The text does a terrible job of explaining where equations and final statement
of problems come from. In particular, the jump to Equations (9.16) and (9.17)
is abrupt. [Wolfram's
MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Levenberg-MarquardtMethod.html) was a
great help here.)

The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) is a line-search trust-region algorithm
used to minimize linear _and_ non-linear least-square problems. That is, it
seeks to minimize functions of the form $$f(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k =
1}^n r_k(\vec{x})^2 = \frac{1}{2} | \vec{r}(\vec{x}) |^2.$$ As a _line search_
algorithm, it has a particular way of determining the direction to search in,
involving Jacobians and linear least-square methods. Overall, it is a _trust
region_ algorithm because it makes assumptions about the function being
minimized within a particular region, called a _trust region_.

## Search Direction

Recall that a line search algorithm works by choosing an initial guess
$\vec{x}_0$, then defining each later point by the equation $$\vec{x}_{n + 1} =
\vec{x}_n + \alpha_n \vec{p}_n,$$ where $\alpha_n$ is the search length and
$\vec{p}_n$ is the search direction.

LMA sets $\alpha_n = 1$ and then chooses $\vec{p}$ in a way that blends two
other methods: gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method. Gradient descent
chooses the direction $\vec{d}_n = -\nabla f(x_n)$, which ends up being defined
by $$\nabla f(x_n)_j = \sum_{k = 1}^n r_k(\vec{x}) \frac{\partial r_k}{\partial
x_j}.$$ If we let $J$ denote the Jacobian of $\vec{r}$, then this gradient
works out to be $$\nabla f(\vec{x}) = J^T \vec{r}.$$ Jumping straight to
Jacobians, the Gauss-Newton method direction is $$\vec{g} = (J^T J)^{-1} J^T
\vec{r}.$$ (For technical reasons, i.e. $J$ may not be square, this inverse
does not always simplify nicely.) Finally, LMA chooses the direction $$\vec{l}
= -(J^T J + \lambda I)^{-1} J^T \vec{r},$$ where the parameter $\lambda$ is a
"dampening" parameter and $I$ is the identity matrix. According to [smart
people](http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/ce281/lm.pdf), if $\lambda$ is large,
then this direction is approximately the same as gradient descent; if it is
small, then the direction is approximately the same as Gauss-Newton.

The trust region as a region where we assume that the function $f$ being
minimized is roughly quadratic. This is an approximating assumption LMA makes
that throws away terms of the taylor expansion of $f$. The size of the trust
region is roughly inversely proportional to the value $\lambda$. The "trust
region growing" means that $\lambda$ decreases, or that we are more comfortable
choosing the more aggressive Gauss-Newton direction. The "trust region
shrinking" means that $\lambda$ increases, or that we are more cautious and
prefer the standard gradient descent direction.

## Algorithmic Sketch

The only head-scratching part in this is evaluating the quadratic trust region
assumption. If a function is quadratic, then we can closely predict its change.
If this prediction is off, then we shrink our trust region. If it is
acceptable, then we change nothing. If it is good, then we increase our trust
region.

(This is a good-faith effort to combine the strange text algorithm with its
online implementation.)

- Choose an initial guess $\vec{x}_0$ for the minimum of $f(\vec{x})$.

- While $J^T \vec{r} > \epsilon > 0$ and a maximum number of iterations is not
  exceeeded:
    - repeat until a new point is found
        - Solve $\vec{l} = -(J^T J + \lambda I)^{-1} J^T \vec{r}$ using linear
          least-squares methods.

        - Set $\vec{x}_{n + 1} = \vec{x}_n + \vec{l}$.

        - Evaluate how well our trust region assumption is working.
            - actual = $|f(\vec{x}_{n + 1}) - f(\vec{x}_n)|$
            - predicted = $\nabla f(\vec{x}_n) \cdot (\vec{x}_{n + 1} -
              \vec{x})$ (note the probable typo on page 196)
            - set $\rho =$ actual/predicted

        - If $0 < \rho < 0.25$:
            - accept new step
        - If $0.25 < \rho$:
            - accept new step
            - increase trust region (decrease $\lambda$)
        - Else ($\rho \leq 0$ (?)[^negative]):
            - reject new step
            - reduce trust region (increase $\lambda$)

[^negative]: This doesn't make much sense. This is negative only if "predicted"
is negative, which doesn't mean anything about the relative magnitude of
errors. It is difficult to parse the author's implementation, since they apply
`np.linalg.norm`, which I believe makes everything positive, then makes the
same positive/negative check.


# Genetic Algorithms

A genetic algorithm applies concepts from evolution to search a solution space
in both exploitative and exploratory ways.

## General Description

A genetic algorithm requires:
    - An _alphabet_ to construct _strings_ from.
    - A _fitness function_ to describe how good a string is.
    - An initial _population_ of test strings.
    - A way to _generate and replace_ new offspring.

__Strings__:

- Some way to encode information about a solution.
- Should _not_ include any information aside from the solution, i.e. no
  information about optimal solutions.
- Keep as small as possible.

__Fitness function__:

- Takes a string and outputs a number called the _fitness_ of that string.
- Higher fitness means more fit.
- Nonnegative function.

__Population__:

- Large list of possible solutions as strings.

__Parent Selection__:

When looking at a population, we need to pick some number to act as parents for
the next generation. In general, we would like to select the most fit
population members, but also to allow some exploration. See page 215.

## The Knapsack Problem

Suppose that we have a knapsack with a finite carrying capacity, and we want to
place objects of different weights into it. In general, there is too much
weight to carry everything. How do we place items into the knapsack to maximize
the weight that we take?

This problem is simple, but is very computationally complex. It is NP-complete.

Here are a few algorithms to convince us that the problem is hard:

- Exhaustive algorithm
    - Checks every possible solution.
    - Guaranteed to find the optimal solution, given enough time.
    - For $n$ items, there are $2^n$ ways to pack them (not accounting for
      invalid combinations), so this is $O(2^n)$.

- Greedy algorithms
    - Grab heaviest/lightest object at each step.
    - Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, and usually won't.
    - For $n$ items, there are $O(n)$ steps.

Between these, we can choose exponential time for an accurate solution, or
linear time for a poor solution. We hope to use genetic algorithms to find
acceptable solutions while keeping fairly low time complexity.

Suppose that we have $L$ items, a max weight of $M$, and that the weight of
item $k$ is $w(k)$.

We will use binary strings to encode solutions, where a 1 in position $k$ means
we are taking item $k$, and a 0 there means we are not taking it.

The fitness function we will use is
$$f(k) =
\begin{cases}
    w(k), & \text{if } w(k) \leq M, \\
    w(k) - 2(w(k) - M), & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

From here on out, we run the GA as described in the previous section.


# Reinforcement Learning

For every reinforcement problem, we must have the following things:

- __State space__:
    - set of states that an agent may be in
    - information that an agent has access to
    - environment information, if it is changing

- __Action space__:
    - set of _all_ possible actions
    - the state space may encode all _possible_ actions from a given state

(We would, in general, like to minimize the size of these spaces.)

- __Reward function__:
    - set by the environment
    - returns an _actual_ reward for every action taken

- __Discounting__:
    - subjective reward function that attempts to predict future rewards from
      an action
    - Choose $\gamma \in [0, 1)$, a measure of how much we believe our
      prediction.
    - Our estimated reward at time $t$ is weighted by $\gamma^t$.

## Action Selection

Every agent must have a way to select an action at each state. To assist in
this, $Q_{s, t}(a)$ is defined as the average reward for choosing action $a$ at
state $s$ after choosing it $t$ times in the past. We would like for $Q_{s,
t}(a)$ to converge to the _actual_ reward for the action.

We can think of $Q_{s, t}(a)$ as a three dimensional table; or as the continual
replacement of a two dimensional table as $t$ increases.

There are various ways to choose the next action:

- __Greedy__: choose the action $a$ that maximizes $Q_{s, t}(a)$.

- __$\epsilon$-Greedy__: generally choose the greedy solution, but with
  $\epsilon$ probability, uniformly choose a random action.

- __Softmax__: Choose an action relative to the softmax probabilities; i.e. set
  $$P(Q_{s, t}(a)) = \frac{\exp(Q_{s, t}(a) / \tau)}{\sum_{k} \exp(Q_{s, t}(k)
  / \tau)}$$ and choose action $a$ relative to this probability^[That is, pick a
  random number $r$. If $r$ is less $P(Q_{s, t}(1)$, then choose action 1. If
  $r$ is larger than it, then examine the second action. And so on until the
  last action is reached.].

RL problems can be split into two classes: episodic and continual. An
_episodic_ problem has a definite goal to be reached. A _continual_ problem has
no definite goal, and goes on indefinitely.

Clearing up the example:

- The agent does _not_ know the overall topography.

- Absorbing states have no actions to choose from.

## Values

The explanation of values is a little abstruse. Roughly, values are the reward
that an agent expects to get from an action at a certain state. That is, they
are a "subjective reward." The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a
policy of choosing actions that will maximize these subjective values.

This policy will be created by initializing all values to small, random
numbers, then exploring the state space. As the agent explores the state space,
it uses the rewards it obtains to update the values it believes each action and
state should have. With any luck, the values will converge to the actual
rewards.

There are two different value functions:

- __State value function__: $$V(s) = E[r_t \mid s_t] = E[\sum_{k = 0}^\infty
  \gamma^k r_{t + k + r} \mid s_t = s].$$
    - Let current policy set action; average over all actions.

- Action-value function: $$Q(s, a) = E[r_t \mid s_t, a_t] = E[\sum_{k =
  0}^\infty \gamma^k r_{t + k + 1} \mid s_t = s, a_t = a]$$
    - Let current policy select action; take the value from only those actions.

The optimal value function $Q^*$ is given by the authors as $$Q^*(s_t, a_t) =
E[r_{t + 1}] + \gamma \max_{a_{t + 1}} Q(s_{t + 1}, a_{t + 1}).$$ This doesn't
seem to build up to much. Later, they give an update formula $$Q(s, a)
\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \mu(r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)).$$

## The Algorithms

Q-Learning and Sarsa do roughly the same thing. The only difference is that
Sarsa uses the "current policy" to make _all_ of its decisions, where
Q-Learning uses $\epsilon$-greedy for some decisions.


# Learning with Trees

\newcommand{\entropy}[1]{\operatorname{Entropy} #1}
\newcommand{\gain}[2]{\operatorname{Gain}\left( #1, #2 \right)}

This section corresponds to Chapter 12. Some of the code in this chapter lacks
a frusterating amount of documentation.

- ID3 is greedy; it grabs the feature with the greatest gain at each step. When
  there are no features left, it grabs the most common class and hopes that it
  works.

    - It's worth noting that the book requires computing the entropy of the
      entire dataset. We don't have to! Gain is given in Equation 12.2. When
      trying to maximize this, $\entropy(S)$ is constant, so the feature that
      has the smallest $- \sum_{f \in values(F)}$ term will maximize gain.

        To see this, let $\sum_F$ and $\sum_{F'}$ be the sigma terms for two
        different features. If $$\sum_F < \sum_{F'},$$ then applying the
        decreasing function $f(x) = \entropy{S} - x$ to this inequality gives
        $$\entropy{S} - \sum_F > \entropy{S} - \sum_{F'},$$ or $$\gain{S}{F} >
        \gain{S}{F'}.$$

- The entropy of a set with classes $C_1,\ C_2,\ \dots,\ C_n$ is calculated
  with the probability $p_k$ being the probability of the class $C_k$ occurring
  in the data set. Equation 12.3 shows this with two classes: true and false.

- `calc_entropy` does not actually compute the entropy that these sections talk
  about; it only _helps_ compute it.

- `calc_info_gain` does not actually compute the gain; it computes the sigma
  term from Equation 12.2, and `make_tree` later computes the gain. It also
  generalizes to an arbitrary number of classes without telling us. Here's my
  best guess at documentation:

```python
def calc_info_gain(data, classes, feature):
    """Compute the sigma term from Equation 12.2 from choosing the given feature.

    data: List of vectors [feature_1, feature_2, ..., feature_n].
    feature: Integer that indexes the feature to be used from the dataset.
    classes: List of the same length of `data`, where `classes[k]` is the class
             of the kth datapoint.

    The possible values will be found by looking directly at the data.
    """
```

## ID3 Example Setup

Here is the setup for an ID3 example (this was the majority of a class period):

Let sex denote our class, with Male and Female being values. We have the
attributes Height (Tall, Medium, Short) and Weight (Heavy, Median, Light).

Consider the following dataset:

Height  | Weight  | Sex 
--|---|--
T | H | M
S | L | F
M | M | M
M | M | M
S | H | M
S | L | F
T | L | F
T | L | M
M | L | F

From the note above, calculate the sigma term in Equation 12.2 for each Height
and Weight, then split on the feature that has the smallest.


# Unsupervised Learning

Chapter 14 introduces us to the concept of _unsupervised learning_, or learning
where an algorithm must learn to classify data without being given
pre-classified examples.

The biggest change from supervised to unsupervised is the lack of targets to
train against. However, because there are no targets, we also can't use any of
our old error functions. They rely on targets or other external information
that we don't have on hand anymore. Thus, we need error functions that can
operate with only a set of datapoints.

As an example of how such an algorithm would work, the text introduces the
_$K$-means algorithm_.

## The $K$-Means Algorithm

The $K$-means algorithm is roughly the unsupervised analog of the $K$-nearest
neighbors algorithm. For $K$-nearest neighbors, an input was classified by
choosing the most common class out of the $K$-nearest examples. This idea
requires that we know the class of the examples; i.e., it is a supervised
algorithm. For $K$-means, we won't have those targets to pick from.

The $K$-means algorithm operates on the same assumption as $K$-nearest
neighbors: datapoints that are close to each other are likely in the same
class, and classes are usually far enough apart to be separated. The $K$-means
algorithm assumes that the data is split into $K$ classes which are separated
enough to be clustered together, then tries to find the center of each cluster
iteratively.

The $K$-means algorithm needs two things: a distance measure, or
[metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)), and a way to
compute the mean. Usually, we use the Euclidean metric, but there are others.

A solid outline of the $K$-means algorithm is given on page 283. One important
thing to note is that the learning process looks at every datapoint before
making any updates. This will change when we introduce neural networks to solve
the problem.

A final point is that the $K$-means algorithm doesn't know anything about class
labels. It can only cluster data, not say what that data is. For example,
suppose that we have a dataset of flowers with the classes "rose" and "lily."
We are given a set of flowers without labels, so we try $K$-means to cluster
the examples. This gives us two clusters, but we don't know which cluster
corresponds to roses, and which to lilies. Assuming that the first cluster
corresponds to the first class, say "rose," could be incorrect. There is not
much we can do to fix this problem.

### The $K$-Means Algorithm as a Neural Network

We can express an _on-line_ version of the $K$-means algorithm as a neural
network. On-line indicates that we will make updates to the network after
seeing each datapoint, not after seeing all of them. There are various reason
that we might want to do this. Perhaps we are being fed data one point at a
time and need to make predictions faster than we can receive data.

The neural network is a single-layer perceptron, with one input neuron for each
feature in the dataset. There are $K$ output neurons representing the $K$
clusters, whose weights are the locations of the center of each cluster. The
activation function used is something like the distance between two points
(more on that later). To choose which output fires, hard-max is used. That is,
the neuron that a point is closest to fires and gets updated. An outline of the
algorithm is given on page 289.

There are a few technical notes about the book's implementation: normalization
and the activation function. The activation function used is $g(\vec{x}) =
\vec{x} \cdot \vec{w}$, where $\vec{w}$ is the weight vector. As the book
claims, this _effectively_ computes the distance between $\vec{w}$ and
$\vec{x}$ under the assumption that $\vec{w}$ and $\vec{x}$ are unit vectors.
What they mean by this is that, if $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{w}$ is at a maximum,
then, $|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|$ is at a minimum. So we pick the output neuron that
maximizes $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}$ using hard-max, and we know that $\vec{x}$ is
closest to this neuron.

To see why this is true, we will examine $|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2$. When this is
minimized, then $|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|$ will also be minimized. Now,
\begin{align*}
    |\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2 &= (\vec{w} - \vec{x}) \cdot (\vec{w} - \vec{x}) \\
                          &= \vec{w} \cdot \vec{w} - 2 \vec{x} \cdot \vec{w} +
                          \vec{x} \cdot \vec{x} \\
                          &= |\vec{w}|^2 - 2 \vec{x} \cdot \vec{w} +
                          |\vec{x}|^2.
\end{align*}
Since $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{w}$ are unit vectors, $|\vec{w}|^2 = |\vec{x}|^2 =
1$, so $$|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2 = 2 - 2 \vec{x} \cdot \vec{w},$$ or $$\vec{x}
\cdot \vec{w} = 1 - \frac{|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2}{2}.$$ Thus, when $\vec{x}
\cdot \vec{w}$ is maximized, so is $$1 - \frac{|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2}{2},$$
meaning that $$\frac{|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2}{2}$$ is at a minimum, and so
$|\vec{w} - \vec{x}|^2$ is as well.


# Random Number Sampling

Sampling from a probability distribution is a key part of any algorithm with
stochastic behavior. Thus, how we get those samples is important.

## The Box-Muller Scheme

Often, we want to sample from a standard normal distribution. If we can sample
from a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, we can generate pairs of numbers from
independent standard normal distributions. This is called the Box-Muller
Scheme, and it's pretty simple:

Given two uniformly distributed random variables $U_1$ and $U_2$ on $[0, 1]$,
let $\theta = 2\pi U_1$ and $r = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_2)}$. Then, $x = r\cos \theta$
and $y = r \sin \theta$ are Gaussian variables with mean zero and standard
deviation one.

The proof of this requires a little bit of multivariate probability theory. The
gist is that, for two independent, standard Gaussian variables $X$ and $Y$,
their product is distributed with density $$f(x, y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}
e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}
e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}}.$$ Next, convert to polar, i.e., set $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$
and $\theta = \arctan(y/x)$. If we can sample $r$ and $\theta$ from a uniform
distribution that maintains this relationship, then we can work in reverse to
recover independent Gaussians.

It works out that $\theta$ is uniformly distributed on $[0, 2\pi]$, and $r$ is
on $[0, 1]$. To sample $\theta$, we can pick $\theta = 2\pi U_1$. To sample
$r$, we need to solve $$P(r \leq R) = 1 - e^{-\frac{r^2}{2}} = 1 - U_2,$$ which
works out to be $r = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_2)}$.

## Proposal Distributions

There is an alternate method to perform the Box-Muller Scheme, which uses the
idea of sampling and rejection.

Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be uniformly distributed random variables on $[-1, 1]$, and
let $w = \sqrt{U_1^2 + U_2^2}$, so that $$w^2 = U_1^2 + U_2^2.$$ If $w^2 < 1$,
i.e. the point $(U_1, U_2)$ lies in the unit circle, then $$x =
U_1\sqrt{\frac{-2\ln(w^2)}{w^2}}$$ and $$y = U_2\sqrt{\frac{-2\ln(w^2)}{w^2}}$$
are independent, standard Gaussian variables.

This new method can be quicker, but requires that we might have to reject some
points. (What's the probability that we'll have to do that?) The idea of
"sample-and-reject" can be used to sample from arbitrary probability
distributions.


# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

Previously, we considered ways to approximate sampling from a distribution that
is difficult to sample from. This included the Box-Muller Scheme (using a
uniform distribution to sample from a standard normal) and the rejection
sampling distribution (using an easier "proposal distribution" to approximate
samples). In this section, we look at using Markov chains to accomplish the
same thing.

## Markov Chains

A Markov Chain is a sequence of states where the probability of being in the
next state depends only on the current state. For examples, think of the
standard "random walk" or "Brownian motion" in probability.

The text does not make use of a lot of Markov chain theory, but it does place a
lot of technical restrictions on the chains. In particular, it requires that
the chains are strongly ergodic. This means that they are irreducible, positive
recurrent, and aperiodic. This doesn't ever make a big appearance in the
section, but it is quite easy to create a non-ergodic Markov chain. If
ergodicity is actually important, we should be careful when just playing with
Markov Chains.

## Markov Chains and Sampling

Some Markov chains have _limiting distributions_. These are analogous to stable
equilibrium points in differential equations. For a limiting distribution, no
matter what state we begin in, after a large number of steps, the probability
of our end position will be described by a constant distribution. Formally, if
$p^{(n)}_{ij}$ is the probability of being in state $i$ after $n$ steps from
state $j$, then $$\lim_{n \to \infty} p^{(n)}_{ij} = \pi_i,$$ where $\pi_i$ is
a constant. Because we require that our Markov chains be strongly ergodic, each
of them has a unique limiting distribution. (Take my word for it.)

Markov chains are very simple to sample from. Start at any state and take a
large number of random steps. The end state is our sampled value. If we can
create an ergodic Markov chain whose limiting distribution is the distribution
we want to sample from, then we can approximate samples from that distribution.
For example, if our Markov chain had a Poisson limiting distribution, then the
end state after a large number of random walks would approximately be a random
value from a Poisson distribution^[It will not do to simply select a state at
random. This would be sampling from a uniform distribution. The walks have to
actually be performed, since that's what the limiting distribution requires.].

To generalize the idea of sampling, we have a proposal distribution $q(x_i \mid
x_i)$. That is, a distribution whose next sample depends only on the current
sample. This is sort of a "generalized" Markov chain. We start with an initial
guess and then we take another sample from this proposal distribution. We take
this new sample only if it is roughly "more likely" than the current sample.
This is done by computing an "acceptance ratio" and accepting the point with
probability equal to this acceptance ratio.

The algorithm runs as follows:

__Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm:__

1. Decide to sample $n$ values and pick an initial sample $x_0$.

2. Set $k = 0$.

3. Loop until $k = n$:

    i. Sample a new value $x^*$ from the proposal distribution.

    ii. Compute the acceptance ratio $$\alpha = \min \left(1, \frac{p(x^*)
    q(x^* \mid x_k)}{p(x_k) q(x_k \mid x^*)} \right).$$

        - Note that $\alpha$ increases if $q$ says that moving to $x^*$ from
          $x_k$ is more likely than moving the opposite direction the current
          sample. It also increases if $p$ says that $x^*$ is more likely than
          $x_k$ in general.

    iii. Pick a uniform number $u$ from $[0, 1]$.

    iv. If $u < \alpha$, then set $x_{k + 1} = x^*$ and $k \leftarrow k + 1$.
    Otherwise, repeat.

4. Celebrate with your $n$ samples.


# Gaussian Process Regression

When given a dataset to perform regression on, we must choose what model to
use. Is the data linear? Exponential? Or maybe something really weird, like
sinusoidal? Generally, to pick the best model, we go through a trial-and-error
process. The goal behind Gaussian Processes is to generalize this
trial-and-error process by selecting different types of models from a
probability distribution.

## Gaussian Processes

A stochastic process is a collection of random variables. For example, the
function $f(x) = \exp(-ax)$, where $a$ is sampled from a standard normal
distribution, can be thought of as a stochastic process. For each sampled value
of $a$, we obtain a new distribution $f(x)$. (This is shown in Figure 18.3.)

A _Gaussian process_ (GP) is a stochastic process where each variable has a
Gaussian distribution, and joining any finite number of them results in another
Gaussian distribution. For example, the stochastic process $f(x)$ above is a
Gaussian process^[I think.].

A regular Gaussian distribution is determined by a mean and covariance matrix.
Likewise, a Gaussian process is determined by mean and covariance _functions_.
That is, a function that describes the mean and covariance matrix of each
random variable. It turns out that any function that is a _kernel_ from SVMs
will do as a covariance function. A common covariance function is the RBF
kernel, $$k(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) = \sigma_f^2 \exp\left( -\frac{|x - y|^2}{2l^2}
\right),$$ where $\sigma_f$ and $l$ are positive parameters.

## Performing Regression

In the context of regression, we make the assumption that sampling is a
Gaussian Process. That is, each datapoint comes from a normal distribution and
any collection of datapoints is also from a normal distribution. This will
allow us to predict the value of a testpoint using the mean of a created normal
distribution.

First, for any set of examples, we subtract off the mean so that everything has
mean zero. This means that we can ignore the mean function. This gives us a set
of points $(\vec{x_k}, t_k)$. Next, we choose some covariance function
$k(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$. From this, we build the covariance matrix for the normal
distribution of the dataset. It is defined by $$K_{ij} = k(\vec{x}_i,
\vec{x}_j).$$

At this point, we are ready to perform regression on a test point $\vec{x^*}$.
Because we assumed that sampling is a Gaussian process, the test point
$\vec{x^*}$ with the dataset are normally distributed. This new distribution
has the covariance matrix (obtained by appending a row and column to $K$)
$$
K_{\vec{x}^*} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    K & \vec{k}^* \\
    \vec{k}^{*T} & k^{**}
\end{bmatrix},
$$
where $K$ is the covariance matrix of the dataset, $\vec{k}^*$ is the vector of
covariances $k(\vec{x}^*, \vec{x})$, and $k^{**} = k(\vec{x}^*, \vec{x}^*)$.

[It works out that](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mebden/reports/GPtutorial.pdf)
the probability that $\vec{x^*}$ should have value $y^*$ given the dataset,
i.e. $$P(y^* \mid (\vec{x}_1, t_1), (\vec{x}_2, t_2), \dots, (\vec{x}_n,
t_n))$$ follows the normal distribution $$N(\mu = \vec{k}^* K^{-1}\vec{t},
\sigma^2 = k^{**} - \vec{k}^* K^{-1} \vec{t}),$$ where $\vec{t} = [t_1, t_2,
\dots, t_n]$. To predict the value that $\vec{x}^*$ should have, we simply take
the mean of this distribution.

## Algorithm Sketch

- Pick a covariance function $k(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$, and create the dataset
  $(\vec{x}_k, t_k)$ with mean zero.

- Compute the covariance matrix $K_{ij} = k(\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}_j)$.

- For each testpoint $\vec{x}^*$:
    - Compute the "covariance vector" $\vec{k^*}$.
    - Compute the covariance $k^{**} = k(\vec{x}^*, \vec{x}^*)$.
    - Predict $y^* = \vec{k}^{*T} K^{-1} \vec{t}$.


# Bayesian Networks

## Computational Examples

Dataset:

A | B | C
--|---|--
T | F | T
T | T | F
T | F | T
F | T | T
F | T | T
F | F | T
F | F | F
F | F | T

$P(A = T) = \frac{3}{8}$

$P(B = T) = \frac{3}{8}$

$P(A = T \mid B = T) = \frac{1}{3}$

$P(B = T \mid A = T) = \frac{1}{3}$

The variables $A$ and $B$ are dependent since $P(A = T \mid B = T) \neq P(A =
T)$. That is, knowing that $B$ occurs affects the probability of $A$ occuring.

The goal is, given a dataset, to create a Bayesian network describing the
dependency relations.

## Score-Based Approach

This is very similar to genetic algorithms.

1. Generate and/or modify Bayesian networks.

2. Evaluate quality of networks using some "score" metric.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with variations on the "best" network.

### Minimum Description Length (MDL)

This is one possible way to score a network.

Suppose that we have $M$ datapoints on a graph $G$ with $N$ attributes. Then,
the MDL is defined as $$L(G) = \frac{1}{M} \log \prod_{k = 1}^M P(D_{k} \mid G)
= \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j = 1}^N \sum_{k = 1}^M \log(P(X_j = d_{kj} \mid C(X_j)),$$
where $X_j$ is the $j$th variable, $d_{kj}$ is the $j$th attribute of the $k$th
datapoint $C(X_j)$ is the conditioning set of $X_j$, or the set of parents of
$X_j$. 

For example (because we desperately need one), consider the dataset from above,
with the graph $G$ described by $A \to C$ and $B \to C$. Then,
\begin{align*}
    L(G) &= \frac{1}{8} \sum_{k = 1}^8 \sum_{j = 1}^3 \log P(X_k \mid C(X_k)) \\
         &= \frac{1}{8} [3\log P(A = T) + 5 \log P(A = F) + \dots]
\end{align*}

## Independence Tests

Formally, two variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent iff $P(X \mid Y) = P(X)$.
When sampling values of $X$ and $Y$, we may never be sure if they are _actually_
independent, since we will never have the full picture. Patterson introduced us
to the $\chi^2$ (chi-squared) test for independence.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent given $Z$.

$\chi^2$ statistic: square of actual minus expected, divided by expected. (?)

Example: Suppose that 100 people took a course. Of those, 50 passed the course.
Of the original 100, 50 passed the first exam, and only 25 of those that passed
the exam passed the course. Is passing the course independent of the first exam?

However (and I quote), of 50 passing the first exam, 35 passed the course. Are
they independent? (What?)

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(35 - 25)^2}{25} = \frac{100}{25} = 4.$$ Roughly, this means
that this is unlikely.

## PC Algorithm

1. Begin with a complete, undirected graph.

2. (Remove direct indepencies.) For all pairs of variables $(X, Y)$, if $X$ and
$Y$ are independent under some independence test, remove the $X \to Y$ edge.

3. (Remove indirect independencies.) For all pairs $(X, Y)$, and for all $Z$
that are adjacent to $X$ _or_ $Y$, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent given $Z$
under some independence test, remove the $X \to Z$ edge.

4. Repeat step 3 for all sets $Z$ of size 2, 3, ..., until out of sets. That is,
check if $X$ and $Y$ are independent given $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ for all adjacent
$Z_1$ and $Z_2$, and so on, for all sizes of the set $Z$.

5. We now have an undirected skeleton. If $(X, Y)$ are _both_ adjacent to $Z$,
then check if $X$ and $Y$ are independent given $Z$. If they are dependent,
then orient edges as $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$.

6. Repeat step 5 until all pairs are tested.

7. If $A \to B$, $B --- C$, the pair $(A, C)$ is not adjacent, and $C \not\to
B$, then set $B \to C$.

8. If $A --- B$ and there's a _directed_ path from $A$ to $B$, then set $A \to
B$.

9. Repeat steps 7, 8 until there is no change. Orient remaining edges randomly.

## Hidden Markov Models

### Forward Algorithm

Goal: Estimate $P(\text{state})$ given a set of observations and the current
model.

Using the Law of Total Probability, $$P(O) = \sum_{r = 1}^R P(O \mid \Omega_r)
P(\Omega_r),$$ where $\Omega_r$ is a possible sequence of states. Since
$\Omega_r$ represents a sequence of states, we will assume that $$P(\Omega_r) =
\prod_{t = 1}^T a_{\Omega_{r, t} \Omega_{r, t + 1}},$$ where $T$ is the number
of states in each $\Omega_r$ and $a_{ij}$ are the transition probabilities of
the Markov chain. We will also assume that $$P(O \mid \Omega_r) = \prod_{t =
1}^T b_{\Omega_{r, t}} (O_k),$$ where $b_{i}(o)$ is the probability of emitting
observation $o$ given that we were in state $i$. Thus, $$P(O) = \sum_{r = 1}^R
\prod_{t = 1}^T b_{\Omega_{r, t}}(O_t) a_{\Omega_{r, t} \Omega_{r, t + 1}}.$$

Runtime: $O(T N^T)$.

Forward Trellis: $R$ and $T$ are usually _really_ big, and that means that $O(T
N^T)$ is hard. The "forward trellis" avoids this by focusing only the the
observations seen and the most likely steps. This gets us down to $O(T N^2)$.

### Baum-Welch (Foward-Backward) Algorithm

Goal: Learn transition and observation probabilities.

Issues:

- Unsupervised learning.

- NP-Complete (almost certainly exponential)

Variables:

- $\beta_i(t) =$ probability that we are in state $i$ at time $t$.

- $\pi_i =$ probability of state $i$ in the initial distribution.

- $a_{ij} =$ probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$.

- $b_i(o_k) =$ probability of observing $o_k$ after being in state $i$.

See page 340 for actual definitions.

Algorithm:

- Initialize $\pi$ to uniform distribution and $a_{ij}$, $b_i(o_k)$ to be random
  probabilities.

- While the algorithm has not converged:

    1. E-step: calculate $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For each $o_t$, $i$, $j$, compute
    $\xi_{i, j, k}$.

    2. M-step:
