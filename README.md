# A Companion of Questionable Quality to _Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective_

This repository contains my notes from an honors course in machine learning
taken in 2016 at Oglethorpe University. They are meant to accompany Marsland's
_Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective_.

The companion is broken up into several markdown files, labeled by section
numbers. There is also a Python file to concatenate them all together into one
big markdown file. The Python file includes a comment with an example `pandoc`
command to build the big document into a nice PDF, which is also included
[here](./out.pdf).

For those on GitHub, I highly recommend reading [the PDF](./out.pdf). GitHub
doesn't render math in its markdown, nor will the files be sorted in a readable
order.
