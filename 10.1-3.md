# Genetic Algorithms

A genetic algorithm applies concepts from evolution to search a solution space
in both exploitative and exploratory ways.

## General Description

A genetic algorithm requires:
    - An _alphabet_ to construct _strings_ from.
    - A _fitness function_ to describe how good a string is.
    - An initial _population_ of test strings.
    - A way to _generate and replace_ new offspring.

__Strings__:

- Some way to encode information about a solution.
- Should _not_ include any information aside from the solution, i.e. no
  information about optimal solutions.
- Keep as small as possible.

__Fitness function__:

- Takes a string and outputs a number called the _fitness_ of that string.
- Higher fitness means more fit.
- Nonnegative function.

__Population__:

- Large list of possible solutions as strings.

__Parent Selection__:

When looking at a population, we need to pick some number to act as parents for
the next generation. In general, we would like to select the most fit
population members, but also to allow some exploration. See page 215.

## The Knapsack Problem

Suppose that we have a knapsack with a finite carrying capacity, and we want to
place objects of different weights into it. In general, there is too much
weight to carry everything. How do we place items into the knapsack to maximize
the weight that we take?

This problem is simple, but is very computationally complex. It is NP-complete.

Here are a few algorithms to convince us that the problem is hard:

- Exhaustive algorithm
    - Checks every possible solution.
    - Guaranteed to find the optimal solution, given enough time.
    - For $n$ items, there are $2^n$ ways to pack them (not accounting for
      invalid combinations), so this is $O(2^n)$.

- Greedy algorithms
    - Grab heaviest/lightest object at each step.
    - Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, and usually won't.
    - For $n$ items, there are $O(n)$ steps.

Between these, we can choose exponential time for an accurate solution, or
linear time for a poor solution. We hope to use genetic algorithms to find
acceptable solutions while keeping fairly low time complexity.

Suppose that we have $L$ items, a max weight of $M$, and that the weight of
item $k$ is $w(k)$.

We will use binary strings to encode solutions, where a 1 in position $k$ means
we are taking item $k$, and a 0 there means we are not taking it.

The fitness function we will use is
$$f(k) =
\begin{cases}
    w(k), & \text{if } w(k) \leq M, \\
    w(k) - 2(w(k) - M), & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

From here on out, we run the GA as described in the previous section.
